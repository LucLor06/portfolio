        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in South Florida before attending the <a href="https://www.usf.edu/">University of South Florida</a>, where I studied Information Science with a focus on web development. During college, I spent much of my free time diving deep into Python, which led me to become proficient in Django. Along the way, I developed a strong foundation in core web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Nearly three years later, Iâ€™ve built several full featured web apps with active users and frequent requests, and I now feel ready to enter the job market. Outside of tech, I enjoy cooking, playing a variety of instruments, and exploring new technologies.</p>
